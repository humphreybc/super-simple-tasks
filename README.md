# Super Simple Tasks

[supersimpletasks.com](http://supersimpletasks.com)

A very simple, 100% client-side tasks app that uses localStorage to save the list and Slip.js for reordering. This exists mainly so I can teach myself Coffeescript and better programming in general.

## Features

- Completely free (as in beer and in freedom)
- No account required
- Works offline through localStorage and chrome.storage.sync
- 100% client-side
- Easy to use
- Drag and drop to reorder tasks (even works on mobile!)
- Mobile support

## Dependencies

Uses [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) along with a few other bits and pieces. Have a look in package.json to see what you'll need, and install with npm install.

## Development

A Gruntfile with a 'dev' task is available for development.

#### Install grunt-cli (may need to use sudo)

    npm install -g grunt-cli

#### Install the node prerequisites

    npm install

#### Run 'grunt dev' to watch for changes. Doesn't uglify.

    grunt dev

#### Build everything from scratch. Uglifies and cache busts.

    rm -r public/
    grunt build

## Start server

    cd public/
    grunt connect

Now visit localhost:9001 to see Super Simple Tasks.

So I don't forget :)

1. app.coffee has an updated version number
1. package.json has updated version number
1. Delete public/ and run 'grunt build'
1. Create a .zip of /public for the Chrome Web Store
1. Test .zip in Chrome Apps & Extensions Developer Tool
1. Commit and push to develop
